<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! My name is Giovanni, and I’m excited to welcome you to my first website.
   I'm currently learning web development, exploring programming, and discovering how to bring ideas to life online.
   This site is part of my journey as a beginner, where I can put my new skills to the test and create something uniquely my own.
   It’s a big learning process, but I’m motivated and thrilled to see what I can achieve.
</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I’m someone who values creativity and constant growth.
   I’m fascinated by how technology shapes the world and how even simple websites have the power to communicate ideas and connect people.
   I’m also passionate about art, films, and exploring the connections between different forms of digital expression.
   Combining these interests with my growing knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is something I look forward to as I improve.
</p>

<p>This website will likely evolve as I learn new things and work on new projects, so feel free to check back anytime!
   I’m eager to expand my skills and turn my ideas into reality.
   Thank you for visiting and being part of my journey in web development!
